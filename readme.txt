== Changelog ==

= 1.1.2 =
* Added support for all public and custom post types (the `attachment` post type is excluded) - all post types can be user searchable or predfined and hidden from the user.  This allows for users to add multiple search widgets to their site which work on specific post types independantly from eachother.
* Added offical updated documentation, created and moved to [Search & Filter Docs](http://docs.designsandcode.com/search-filter/)

= 1.1.1 =
* Fixed: when submitting an empty search/filter, "?s=" now gets appended to the url (an empty search) to force load a results page, previously this was redirecting to the homepage which does not work for many use cases

= 1.1.0 =
* Added support for checkboxes and radio buttons, with the option to control this for each individual taxonomy.
* Added support to show or hide headings for each individual taxonomy.
* Added support to pass a class name through to Search & Filter widgets, this allows styling of different instances of Search & Filter
* Fixed problems with escaping output in search box
* Notice: This update will automatically add headings to taxonomy dropdowns, refer to usage and examples on how to disable them.

= 1.0.3 =
* Added some documention & screenshots to plugin page

= 1.0.2 =
* Version bump for WordPress plugins site

= 1.0.1 =
* Updated to use `label->all_items` in taxonomy object for dropdowns before using `label->name`
* Notice: This update may cause some labels to break, ensure you have set up your taxonomy properly including setting `label->all_items`

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial Release

== Upgrade Notice ==

Upgrade should be fully compatible with previous versions.  A previous update however automatically added headings to dropdowns, refer to usage and examples on how to disable them if this is not the required behaviour.

== Description ==

Search & Filter is a simple search and filtering plugin for WordPress.  It is essentially an advancement of the WordPress search box, adding taxonomy and post type filters to really refine your searches.

You can search by Category, Tag, Custom Taxonomy, Post Type or any combination of these easily - you can even remove the search box and simply use it as a filtering system for your posts and pages.  Taxonomies and Post Types can be displayed as dropdown selects, checkboxes or radio buttons.
